## ✨ Features

### 🔹 Basic Arithmetic Operations
Perform essential mathematical calculations between arrays:
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Power operations using np.power()

### 🔹 Statistical Operations
Gain insights from numerical data using:
- mean(), median(), std(), var()
- min(), max(), sum(), prod()
- Array attributes: shape, size, and dtype

### 🔹 Array Manipulation
Work with arrays like a pro:
- Reshaping arrays dynamically
- Sorting and reverse sorting
- Extracting unique elements
- Accessing first and last elements
- Filtering values greater than the mean
